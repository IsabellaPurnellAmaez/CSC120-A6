What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?

I can absolutely see how its helpful to deduce what is going wrong in the code. Unit Testing seems to be good at identifying instances when code is expected to do one thing (throw an error, return something specific, etc) and then it doesn't. It seems to be more difficult to find more minute bugs that maybe only effect very specific edge cases that do not always occur in the program. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I had a really difficult time with this assignment. A lot of the bugs I can find boil down to different bugs earlier in the code so I'm not sure if they count multiple times if the actual issues stem from elsewhere in the code. I am currently unable to find 2 bugs and I worry that the issues with the buy method in ResaleShop can be condense. 

I tried to identify bugs in the code and then write tests for them and I'm not sure if the best way to approach Unit Testing. I'm not sure how to approach Unit Testing so that the tests identify the bugs instead of the other way around.
